Spacewalk 0.5 Release Notes
===========================

The Spacewalk team is happy to announce another release of Spacewalk. In a few hours, Spacewalk 0.5 will be available for install. As with previous releases, 0.3 will no longer be available.

NOTE: upgrades are not yet available for 0.5. We hope to have these instructions ready later this week.
