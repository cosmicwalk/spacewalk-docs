Some notes about the PostgreSQL support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've been fixing bits and pieces that prevented Spacewalk to use PostgreSQL database server to store the data. Currently known to work are:

* content sync with satellite-sync and spacewalk-repo-sync;
* rhnpush;
* client registration;
* yum operations.

So it is possible to use Spacewalk on PostgreSQL to manage the rpm packages on your machines. For the above mentioned areas, please use bugzilla to report the bugs just like you would normally do.

The PostgreSQL port is however far from complete, so sooner than later you will encouncer weird behavior or Internal Server Error, especially if you use functionality not listed above. For that we will appreciate patch rather than bugzilla report -- we know these do not work and we need help. If you are ready to code, please check

* `PostgreSQL <https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/PostgreSQL>`_
* `PostgreSQLPortingGuide <https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/PostgreSQLPortingGuide>`_
