Features & Enhancements
-----------------------

* SHA256 Feature - support for packages with checksums other than MD5. Spacewalk server and proxy can serve and accept rpms with SHA256 digests, show the checksums in webUI and accept them in API calls.
* Moved from mod_python to mod_wsgi on Fedora 11 and Fedora 12, which promises better performance.
* Improved performance of System Set Management when working with thousands of packages.
* Improved performance of API.
* Fixed number of bugs on Fedora 12 both on client and server side.
* Improved kickstarts and kickstating via proxy.
* Improved client hardware info reporting.
* Basic support for cobbler 2.0 version.

...and many bugfixes.
